# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It covers key concepts, activities, and tools required to perform effective Requirement Analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and defining the functional and non-functional needs of a system or application. It plays a critical role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.

This phase involves gathering input from stakeholders, analyzing business goals, and creating structured documentation to guide the development process.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential in the SDLC for the following reasons:

- **Prevents Miscommunication:** Ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals and requirements.
- **Reduces Costs and Delays:** Identifies potential issues early in the development process, minimizing costly changes later.
- **Ensures Quality:** Provides a clear roadmap for developers, testers, and designers to create a product that meets user expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and elaborating on gathered requirements using techniques like brainstorming and prototyping.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating detailed documents, including requirement specifications and use cases.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Structuring and modeling requirements to identify inconsistencies or gaps.
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing and validating requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do. Examples for the booking management system:
- Users can search for available properties.
- Users can book a property with specific dates.
- The system sends email notifications after a booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system performs tasks. Examples for the booking management system:
- The system must handle 1000 concurrent users.
- Page load time must not exceed 2 seconds.
- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.


## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between system actors and use cases. They provide a clear understanding of system functionality and user interactions.
