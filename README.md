# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It covers key concepts, activities, and tools required to perform effective Requirement Analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and defining the functional and non-functional needs of a system or application. It plays a critical role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the final product meets user expectations and business objectives.

This phase involves gathering input from stakeholders, analyzing business goals, and creating structured documentation to guide the development process.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential in the SDLC for the following reasons:

- **Prevents Miscommunication:** Ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project goals and requirements.
- **Reduces Costs and Delays:** Identifies potential issues early in the development process, minimizing costly changes later.
- **Ensures Quality:** Provides a clear roadmap for developers, testers, and designers to create a product that meets user expectations.
